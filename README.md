# 🧠 Terrorism Insights & Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical terrorism data using **Microsoft Power BI** to uncover trends, identify impacted regions, and understand terrorism patterns.  
It consists of two dashboards:
- 🌍 **Global Terrorism Dashboard**
- 🇮🇳 **Terrorism in India Dashboard**

The goal is to convert raw terrorism data into **interactive, visual, and insightful analytics** for better understanding.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global terrorism trends over time  
- Identify most affected countries and regions  
- Understand attack types and weapon usage patterns  
- Evaluate killed, wounded, and casualty distribution  
- Provide a detailed analysis focused on India  
- Demonstrate real-world analytics using Power BI
